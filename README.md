### Catherine's personal page using React
This website contains three linked pages, created using React. It is a reworking of the previous github submission which was created using only html and css. Bootstrap was used for styling, as well as some CSS to make it a little more bespoke. Rows and Columns were incorporated as react components, this enables the website to be responsive when viewed on different sizes of screen.
